   - Auto-notify if spots open
   - Shows demand for future events

### Communication Cadence
- **Monthly newsletter:** Full schedule + next month's events
- **Weekly IG posts:** Next event reminder + registration link
- **48-hour reminder:** Email + story for upcoming events
- **24-hour reminder:** Final call stories
- **Day-of:** Morning reminder + logistics

### Revenue Tracking
