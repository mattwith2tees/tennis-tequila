                    I was nervous to show up because I'd never held a racquet before. Within 10 minutes, 
                    people were teaching me the basics and cheering me on. Best decision I've made.

                    The energy here is unmatched. Everyone's so welcoming and the workouts are legit - 
                    drills, ball machine, actual practice. I've improved so much.

                    I tried other tennis groups but always felt like an outsider. Here, I felt welcomed 
                    from day one. The people are what make this place special.
